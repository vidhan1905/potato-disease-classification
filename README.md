# Potato Leaves Disease Classification using CNN

# Overview
This project aims to classify potato leaves into one of three classes: Early Blight, Late Blight, and Healthy, using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Accurate classification of potato leaves can help farmers identify and mitigate plant diseases, ultimately leading to improved crop yield.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project is a collection of labeled images of potato leaves, with three classes:

Potato___Early_blight

Potato___Late_blight

Potato___healthy
